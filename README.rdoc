= Timepiece

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.

Include "//= require timepiece" in application.js

Add a functional clock to your views with "<%= timepiece %>"

Pass a timezone paramater, e.g. "<%= timepiece('London') %>" (Defaults to 'UTC')

Timepiece will automatically generate a digital clock and keep it updated.
